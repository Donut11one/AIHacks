✈️ AI Travel Planner: Dream Trip Generator

Project Overview

The AI Travel Planner is a modern web application designed to simplify and personalize the process of planning complex trips. Instead of manually searching for destinations, activities, and estimating costs, users simply input their travel parameters (dates, starting point, destination, and interests), and the application uses the Gemini API to generate a detailed, day-by-day itinerary complete with an estimated budget.

This tool aims to provide a reliable starting point for travel planning, blending the creativity of a large language model with structured, actionable travel data.

✨ Key Features

Intelligent Itinerary Generation: Leverage the Gemini API to create unique, optimized, and context-aware travel plans based on user input, focusing on declared interests.

Core Trip Customization: Input essential travel parameters:

Start Date

End Date

Starting Location

Final Destination

Interests/Themes: Specify activities like shopping, hiking, historical tours, local events, or culinary experiences.

Cost Estimation (Aspiration Feature): The AI attempts to provide a realistic, estimated budget for the suggested activities, accommodations, and transport. Note: Actual costs may vary.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean, responsive design ensures a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
